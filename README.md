Coming Soon# Air Reservation System – Manifest

This manifest lists the main project files and briefly describes their purpose.

## Top-level

- `app.py`  
  Main Flask application entry point. Creates the Flask app, loads configuration, registers all blueprints
  (`auth`, `customer`, `agent`, `staff`, `search_flights`, `flight_status`), and defines the root route
  for the public index page.

- `db.py`  
  Wrapper around `mysql.connector`. Exposes `get_connection()` which creates and returns a database
  connection using settings from `config.py`.

- `config.py`  
  Stores configuration values such as MySQL credentials, database name, and Flask secret key.

- `air_reservation.sql`  
  SQL script to create and populate the database schema (tables, foreign keys, and sample data).

- `requirement.txt`  
  Python dependency list (Flask, mysql-connector-python, bcrypt, etc.), used to recreate the environment.

- `.DS_Store` / `.venv` / `venv/` / `__pycache__/`  
  Environment / cache / OS-generated files (not logically part of the application, can be ignored by graders).

## Package: `routes/`

- `routes/__init__.py`  
  Makes `routes` a Python package so blueprints can be imported.

- `routes/auth.py`  
  Authentication and registration logic:
  - Customer and booking-agent registration.
  - Unified login for customers, booking agents, and airline staff (admin/operator) using bcrypt-hashed passwords.
  - Sets session fields (`user_role`, `user_email` or `user_id`, names) and handles logout.

- `routes/customer.py`  
  Customer-facing functionality:
  - Customer dashboard after login.
  - Viewing upcoming and past purchased flights, with date/origin/destination filters.
  - Purchasing tickets for a selected flight.
  - Spending summary (default last 12 months + custom date range).
  - Viewing and editing customer personal information (profile).

- `routes/agent.py`  
  Booking-agent functionality:
  - Agent dashboard after login.
  - Searching flights on behalf of customers (re-uses search logic).
  - Purchasing tickets for a customer (with agent recorded in `purchases`).
  - Commission summary (last 30 days, last year, custom date range).
  - Top customers by tickets and by commission.

- `routes/staff.py`  
  Airline staff functionality and analytics:
  - Decorators `staff_login_required`, `admin_required`, `operator_required`.
  - Staff dashboard listing flights of the staff’s airline with filters (date range, origin, destination).
  - Passenger list for a particular flight.
  - All flights taken by a specific customer on the staff airline.
  - Analytics: top booking agents, most frequent customer, tickets sold per month, delay vs on-time stats, top destinations.
  - Admin actions: add airports and airplanes, create new flights, associate booking agents with the airline.
  - Operator actions: update status of flights (e.g., on-time, delayed, in-progress).

- `routes/search_flights.py`  
  Public flight-search logic:
  - Handles search requests from the home page.
  - Accepts origin, destination, and date (date required; origin/destination optional).
  - Returns matching upcoming flights for display in `search_results.html`.

- `routes/flight_status.py`  
  Public flight-status lookup:
  - Takes airline name and flight number from the home page form.
  - Queries the `flight` table and renders `flight_status.html`.
